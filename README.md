Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) Chatbot
🚀 About the Project
This project is an advanced chatbot built using a Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) architecture. Unlike traditional chatbots that rely solely on pre-trained knowledge, this bot enhances its capabilities by retrieving information from an external knowledge base before generating a response. This approach ensures more accurate, up-to-date, and context-aware conversations, making the bot more reliable for specific domains or information.

🌟 Features
Context-Aware Responses: The chatbot first retrieves relevant documents from a knowledge base to inform its answer, preventing common hallucinations seen in large language models.

Real-time Interaction: Provides instant, engaging, and relevant replies to user queries.

Source Citation: The chatbot can cite the source documents it used to form its response, building user trust and allowing for further research.

Scalable Knowledge Base: The vector database can be easily updated with new information without retraining the entire model.

🛠️ Technologies Used
Python

LangChain - For orchestrating the RAG pipeline.

Vector Database (e.g., ChromaDB, Pinecone) - For storing and retrieving document embeddings.

Large Language Model API (e.g., OpenAI, Google Gemini) - For generating the final response.

Flask - For the web-based chat interface.
